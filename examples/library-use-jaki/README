This example shows how to use a ClojureScript library.
In this case jaki, a CouchDB client library.
All this example does, is load and display a list of local CouchDB databases.
You will need a running CouchDB server.
Compile with
$ cljsc src '{:optimizations :simple :pretty-print true}' > couches.js

Note: I could not get whitespace and advanced compilation to work.
Send me an email if you do.
